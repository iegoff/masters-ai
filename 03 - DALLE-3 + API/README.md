# README

This repository contains a simple Node.js script that does the following:

1. Checks if an OpenAI API key is set in your environment (`OPENAI_API_KEY`).
2. If none is found, prompts you to provide one interactively (with the option to exit).
3. Asks you for a prompt for image generation.
5. Sends the prompt  to the OpenAI Image generation API and prints the result.
