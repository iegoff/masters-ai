# README

This repository contains a simple Node.js script that does the following:

1. Checks if an OpenAI API key is set in your environment (`OPENAI_API_KEY`).
2. If none is found, prompts you to provide one interactively (with the option to exit).
3. Prompts you for a filename (defaults to `rec.mp3` if left empty).
4. Reads the content of the specified file.
5. Sends the file content to the OpenAI Whisper API and prints the result.
