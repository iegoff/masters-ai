The good news, good news, we are on track right and here, here we are meeting number five,
so today we're going to discuss with the API and local installation.
The bad news, I took a look at some of the Chromeworks like two or three maybe five but not
like very very high level. I like the blog posts you guys made so I like the pictures and I think
I will share some of my favorite pictures next time, so I assume I will need this weekend to check
them and probably to add in the like set some marks or something like that, so just give me some time
but I haven't found any like critical problems there, so just remember to share the workflow,
how you how you did that like for the first task, so I need to see like what prompts you've been
using and don't forget about the pictures, so the pictures are necessary for our blog posts.
So I think we're going to focus on that probably either on this lecture or this one,
we're going to have time to review the Chromeworks, but today we're going to discuss with this
API and this is very, let me show this slide, so here are the slides for today,
so what is the visper and why we're discussing that, so mostly when people
discuss the Generative AI or AI in general, so a focus stone like LLAMs,
I know like Cappalats, Functions and stuff like that, so everything that works with text,
right, because it has more application to the business when you work with text, but still
usually what is being forgotten is images and audio processing can't,
getting the images I can't see.
