![CapstoneUI](streamlit.png)
## Overview
This project is a **Streamlit-based AI-powered assistant** designed to retrieve and analyze **Dubai real estate transactions** using public data from the **Dubai Land Department**. The application also fetches **currency exchange rates for AED** and provides insights into property transactions via an interactive dashboard.
 [ðŸš€Demo is here](https://dubiprop.streamlit.app/)
## Features
- **Fetch Dubai Property Transactions** from an official API
- **Retrieve Exchange Rates** for AED to other currencies
- **Interactive Dashboard** for real estate analysis
- **AI Chatbot** for querying transactions using OpenAI API
- **Graphical Data Representation** using Matplotlib
- **Retry Mechanism** for handling HTTP request failures
- **Secure API Key Management** using `.env` file
